leanjs
======

A lean, lightweight javascript framework.

ideas for collections

<div id="mydiv" data-model="app.model.people">

</div>

thoughts on using collections for html lists
	allow tokens in id attribute(otherwise generate one)
	clone all child nodes

things needed:
	dispose() method for all lean apis
		should be recursive

Needed documentation

api docs
browser support
dependencies
getting started
screen casts
user guide
